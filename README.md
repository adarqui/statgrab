## Introduction

Haskell bindings to the portable system statistics `libstatgrab` library.

`libstatgrab` is a library that provides cross platform access to statistics
about the system on which it's run. It's written in C and presents a selection
of useful interfaces which can be used to access key system statistics.
The current list of statistics includes CPU usage, memory utilisation, disk usage,
process counts, network traffic, disk I/O, and more.

The current list of supported and tested platforms includes OSX, FreeBSD, Linux,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, DragonFly BSD, HP-UX and AIX.

Please see the `libstatgrab` [homepage](http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/)
for more information.
